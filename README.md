# Starches


<span style="color:blue"> ## What is starch </span>

The word "starch" is from a Germanic root with the meanings "_strong, stiff, strengthen, stiffen_". Modern German _Stärke_ (strength) is related. The Greek term for starch, "_amylon_" (_ἄμυλον_), is also related. 

Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. 
This **polysaccharide** is produced by most green plants as energy storage. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods like potatoes, wheat, maize (corn), rice, and cassava.


## Starch food

Starches  can  be  divided  into  **three  general  categories:  grains  (grass  seeds),  roots  and  tubers,  and  legumes**. 

### Breads and Grains

Foods in this group include pasta, breads, popcorn, crackers, tortillas, cereals, rice, oatmeal, barley, millet and other grains. 

Creatures that naturally eat grains, which are the seeds of grasses, are called "**granivores**." Many birds  in  nature  live  on  the  seeds  of grasses  and  weeds. 

Of course,  in nature we would  all reject grass  seeds  as  foods.  First,  they  grow  in  a form we  can  neither chew nor digest.  Grain-eatingpossess  a "crop,"  a pouch  in  their throats  or gullets,  where the grains they  swallow whole  are  allowed  to  germinate,  thereby becoming digestible.  **Grains  are  indigestible raw,  but  even  cooked,  the  complex  carbohydrates  in  them  require  great  digestive  effort to  break  down**. 

Heavy on  starches,  grass  seeds  such  as  wheat berries  would  gag us  if  we  attempted  to  eat  the  equivalent  of a  spoonful  or  two  (assuming  we  could  gather  them,  and remembering  that  they  would  have  their husks intact,  as  we  would have to  eat them  in nature)  Further,  eating  a tablespoon  of raw  flour  made  from  the  seeds  of any  cereal  grain  would  also produce  a gag response because  it  is  so  dry.  Thus,  even  though  most of the human race presently  consumes  grains  and  starches,  **we  can reject them  as  natural human  fare**.  The  fact that grass  seeds neither  attract,  tantalize, nor arouse us  in their raw natural state  should  amply  indicate  to you  that we were  not granivores  in  nature  before  we  mastered fire.

### Starchy Vegetables

Starchy vegetables include peas, corn, potatoes, cassava, taro, water chestnuts, plantains, green bananas and lima beans.

Animals  that  grub  for  roots  and  rubers  are  anatomically  designed  for  the  task:  they  have  snouts;  humans  do  not.  Without  tools,  humans  are  very  poor  diggers.  Further,  they  have  no  motivation  to  dig,  for  there  are  no  foods  below  ground  that,  in  their  natural  state,  please  the  palate,  and  **very  few  exist  that  our  digestive  systems   can   even   handle**. 

### Beans and Other Legumes

Beans and other legumes have the distinction of counting as both starchy foods and protein foods. These include lentils, kidney beans, black-eyed peas, chickpeas, black beans, white beans, pinto beans and any other types of dried beans.

Very   few   creatures   other   than   birds   and   pigs   readily   consume  legumes,  as   **legumes  in  their  mature  state  are  indigestible  and/or  toxic  to  most  mammals**.  For  humans,  raw  mature  legumes  are  not just unpalatable,  they  are  quite  toxic.  We  simply  have  no  capacity  for  consuming  them  in  their  natural  state.

Invariably **when eating  legumes,  humans  get gassy,  an  indication  that  their digestive processes  have  been  compromised**. 


## Starches and digestion

**Concentrated starchy foods can cause a great deal of trouble in the colon and can also be dangerous for the heart. The digestion of such starches in excessive quantities causes the creation of abnormal amounts of carbon which becomes carbonic acid gas. To avoid this danger we need to reduce our consumption of starches to a minimum or, better still, avoid them**.

Devitalized starches and sugar are both mucus culprits and when removed from the diet the beneficial results are perceptive.

To fully digest starchy foods - grains, roots and tubers, and legumes - animal must produce large quantities of starch-digesting enzymes (amylases). Granivores, root grubbers and legume eaters all secrete sufficient amylase to digest large quantities of starch. 

In contrast, **the human body produces salivary amylase (also  called  ptyalin) of extremely limited strength and in relatively low amounts, sufficient only to break down small amounts of starch**, such as would be found in fruit that is not fully ripened.  **The body also produces small quantities of pancreatic amylase for somewhat limited starch digestion in the intestines**.

Because cooked grains create a condition known as acid toxemia, people who adhere to starch/grain-based diets eventually fall victim to cancer, arthritis,  chronic fatigue, hypothyroidism, and a host of other health challenges. 

Even  if we  can physically  chew  and  swallow  **starchy  carbohydrates,  they  are very difficult   for  our  bodies   to   digest**.   This   is   true   whether   they   are   eaten   raw,   soaked,   cooked,   processed,  or  refined. **We  do  not  have  the  digestive  enzymes  to  break  down  the  oligosaccharides  in  beans,  nor  the  polysaccharides  (cellulose  and  other  fibers)  in  grains  and  starchy  vegetables,  a  sure  sign  that they  are  not designed for  human  consumption**.

**Biochemistry  tells  us  exactly  which  foods  we  can  and  cannot  digest,  and  therefore  what  foods we  should  eat**.  

In  all  cases,  however,  **grains,  starchy  tubers,   and  legumes  create  nutritional,  digestive,  and  health  problems  for  those  who  eat  them.  Even  when  soaked  and  raw,  grains  are  acid  forming  in  a  body  that needs  to  be  slightly  alkaline**. 
 
 
###### Bananas

If you  have  a  hard  time  eating  very  many  bananas,  it  is  likely  they  are  not  at  peak  ripeness.  The  common  variety  of  banana,  the  cavendish,   is  ripe  when  it  is  generously  speckled  with  brown  spots  and  smells  sweet.  Prior  to  this  state,  they  contain  more  starch  and  are  harder  to  digest.
