## Starches

### What is starch

The word "starch" is from a Germanic root with the meanings "_strong, stiff, strengthen, stiffen_". Modern German _Stärke_ (strength) is related. The Greek term for starch, "_amylon_" (_ἄμυλον_), is also related. 

Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. 
This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants as energy storage. It is the most common carbohydrate in human diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods like potatoes, wheat, maize (corn), rice, and cassava.


### Starches and colon

Concentrated starchy foods can cause a great deal of trouble in the colon and can also be dangerous for the heart. The digestion of such starches in excessive quantities causes the creation of abnormal amounts of carbon which becomes carbonic acid gas. To avoid this danger we need to reduce our consumption of starches to a minimum or, better still, avoid them.

Devitalized starches and sugar are both mucus culprits and when removed from the diet the beneficial results are perceptive.
